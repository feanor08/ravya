      "content": "House of Ravya was born from a desire to bring India\u2019s timeless textile heritage into the lives of families around the world. What began as a deep appreciation for handcrafted fabrics has grown into a conscious design house creating soulful babywear and pet accessories, woven with care and cultural depth.\n\nAt HOR, we collaborate with master artisans across India\u2014reviving age-old crafts like Ajrakh, hand block printing, and khadi weaving. Each piece is created slowly and mindfully, using natural materials and traditional processes that honor the earth and those who work with it.\n\nOur journey is rooted in simplicity, authenticity, and emotion. We believe that what touches the skin of a baby or a beloved pet should be as honest and pure as the love they bring into our lives.\n\nFrom the first thread to the final touch, every product carries a story of human hands, heritage, and heart. This is not just fashion\u2014it is a homecoming to values we hold dear: warmth, comfort, and conscious living.\n\nWelcome to House of Ravya.\nRooted in India. Raised for the world.",
